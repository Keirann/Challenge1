**Description**

> The goal for this exercise is to create a web application using provided assets, designs and data mocks ups. Ideally the application will consist of separate web components which can be interacted with. When a user clicks on a new date in the date picker, the content on the page should be swapped out based on the JSON file provided. 

** How to run **
1. Clone the Repo `git clone https://github.com/Keirann/Challenge1.git`
2. Change the directory to downloaded Repo and Run `npm install`. (This shall install the dependencies)
3. Run `npm run dev`

** Hosted on Heroku**
Optionally the app can be tested at [heroku app]: https://fast-ravine-47845.herokuapp.com/
